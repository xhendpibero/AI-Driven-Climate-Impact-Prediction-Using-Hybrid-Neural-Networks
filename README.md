# QML-for-Conspicuity-Detection-in-Production

## Overview

This project leverages Quantum Machine Learning (QML) techniques to improve conspicuity detection in production environments. By integrating classical and quantum methods, the goal is to explore and demonstrate the potential advantages of QML in real-world applications.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Required Python packages listed in requirements.txt

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/xhendpibero/AI-Driven-Climate-Impact-Prediction.git
cd AI-Driven-Climate-Impact-Prediction
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up and preprocess the data:

- Download climate datasets from external sources (NOAA, NASA).
- Place raw data in the data/raw/ directory.
- Run preprocessing scripts in the notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb notebook to prepare the data for analysis.

## Workflow

1. Data Preparation:

- Use the scripts in src/data/ to preprocess datasets for training. The sine_qml/sine_data.py script specifically generates and saves sine wave data.

2. Model Training:

- To train the main conspicuity detection model, run src/train.py.
- For the sine wave QML model, navigate to src/sine_qml/ and run train_sine.py.

3. Visualization:

- Use sine_visualize.py to visualize the results of the sine wave prediction model.
Results
- The sine wave prediction results are saved in the saved_data/ directory and can be visualized using the sine_visualize.py script.
- For the conspicuity detection model, results will be generated and stored according to the configurations in the train.py script.
