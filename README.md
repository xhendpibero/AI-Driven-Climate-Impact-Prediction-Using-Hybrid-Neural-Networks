# Quantum AI-Driven Climate Impact Prediction Using Hybrid Neural Networks

## Overview

This project aims to leverage AI and machine learning to predict and analyze the impact of climate change on global parameters such as temperature, sea levels, and extreme weather events. The goal is to develop a hybrid neural network model that combines classical deep learning with advanced machine learning techniques to process and analyze large-scale climate datasets. This predictive model will contribute to understanding and mitigating the effects of climate change.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark (Optional for big data processing)
- Required Python packages listed in requirements.txt

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Driven-Climate-Impact-Prediction.git
cd AI-Driven-Climate-Impact-Prediction
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up and preprocess the data:

- Download climate datasets from external sources (NOAA, NASA).
- Place raw data in the data/raw/ directory.
- Run preprocessing scripts in the notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb notebook to prepare the data for analysis.

## Workflow

1. Understanding Climate Data and AI Models
Explore large-scale climate datasets from sources like NOAA, NASA, etc.
Study relevant AI models for climate prediction, such as CNNs and RNNs.
Investigate big data tools for processing climate datasets.

2. Neural Network Architecture Design
Choose a hybrid neural network architecture combining CNNs for spatial data and RNNs for temporal data.
Integrate machine learning models for tasks like anomaly detection and trend prediction.

3. Data Preprocessing
Collect and preprocess climate data, including temperature, CO2 levels, sea ice extent, etc.
Normalize and convert the data into formats suitable for neural network input.

4. Model Development
Implement the hybrid neural network using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Train the model on historical climate data to predict future impacts.
Utilize big data processing for handling large datasets.

5. Experimentation: Training & Testing
Train and test the model on different climate scenarios.
Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Fine-tune the model to improve predictions and reduce error rates.

6. Visualization and Analysis
Visualize predicted climate impacts using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Analyze results to gain insights into potential future climate scenarios.
Generate reports and share findings with the scientific community.

## Results
